> **What are Google Developer Student Clubs?** Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) are university based community groups for students interested in Google developer technologies.
Students from all undergraduate or graduate programs with an interest in growing as a developer are welcome.
By joining a GDSC, students grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their community.

Google Developer Student Clubs - IUH (IUH GDSC) is a community of developer students at [Industrial University of Ho Chi Minh City](http://iuh.edu.vn/en) - Nguyen Van Bao Campus, Go Vap District, HCMC.
